To run the Octave script, simply go into one of the two directories

1) horseshoe_complex_data_sfcas/
2) ni_cubane_data_sfcas/

and type:
"octave ../heis_nsite_sfcis.m"
at the command line on a computer with octave installed.

To obtain the BS-DFT J couplings, another script exists in each folder called "bs-dft.m"
To run, simply go into the folder and type "octave bs-dft.m"
